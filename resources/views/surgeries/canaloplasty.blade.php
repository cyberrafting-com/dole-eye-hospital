                        <h1>Canaloplasty in Pune: Restoring Vision with Advanced Surgical Technique</h1>
                        <p>Canaloplasty is an innovative surgical procedure that offers hope to individuals suffering from glaucoma. This debilitating eye condition affects millions of people worldwide. With its remarkable success rate and long-lasting benefits, canaloplasty has gained popularity as an effective treatment option.</p> 
                        <p>Dole Eye Clinic, known for its advanced medical facilities and skilled healthcare professionals, canaloplasty has emerged as a reliable solution for restoring vision and improving the quality of life for patients.</p>

                        <h2>Introduction to Canaloplasty</h2>
                        <p>Canaloplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure designed to treat glaucoma, characterized by increased intraocular pressure that can lead to optic nerve damage and vision loss.</p>
                        <p>Unlike traditional treatment approaches, such as medications or trabeculectomy, canaloplasty focuses on restoring the eye's natural drainage system. By enlarging the eye's drainage canal and improving fluid outflow, canaloplasty helps regulate intraocular pressure and prevent further damage.</p>

                        <h2>Glaucoma: Causes</h2>
                        <p>Glaucoma can occur due to various factors, including age, genetics, and certain medical conditions. The condition gradually develops over time and often remains asymptomatic in the early stages. Elevated IOP is the most common cause of glaucoma, which can occur when the fluid (aqueous humor) inside the eye does not drain properly. This can lead to damage to the optic nerve over time.</p>

                        <h2>Traditional Treatment Approaches for Glaucoma</h2>
                        <p>Before the advent of canaloplasty, traditional treatment options for glaucoma mainly focused on reducing intraocular pressure through medications, laser surgery, or trabeculectomy. While these approaches can provide temporary relief, they often require lifelong use of medications or repeated surgeries. Moreover, they may carry certain risks and limitations, making canaloplasty an appealing alternative.</p>
